### G'day ðŸ‘‹

I'm an independent generalist technologist with an interest in open source vulnerability management and related software supply chain security.

Most recently, I've worked as a Software Engineer on Google's Open Source Security Team (GOSST) working on [OSV.dev](https://github.com/google/osv.dev). 

I'm passionate about a solid foundation of machine-readable vulnerability metadata for known vulnerability detection/remediation/prevention (aka "management").

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [OSV Schema](https://github.com/ossf/osv-schema) level things as a community contributor to the [OpenSSF's Vulnerability Disclosures Working Group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures) and systemic CVE data quality initiatives via the [CVE Program's Quality Working Group (QWG)](https://github.com/CVEProject/quality-workgroup)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying a [Bachelor of Psychological Science and Counselling](https://www.acap.edu.au/courses/bachelor-of-psychological-science-and-counselling/) at ACAP University College
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my feelings on CVE aggregate data quality/completeness/fitness for purpose

- âš¡ Fun fact: I've been a Linux Systems Administrator, Site Reliability Engineer (Systems Administration), Security Engineer and Software Engineer at Google, spanning two decades in Mountain View, CA and remotely in Brisbane, Australia
